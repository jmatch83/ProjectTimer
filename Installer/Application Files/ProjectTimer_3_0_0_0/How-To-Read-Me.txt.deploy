Created by: Jason Atcheson (jmatch83@gmail.com)
Latest release date: 7.5.2013

Project Timer Keeper is designed to help track time spent on various projects.

Functions:
* List projects
* Track timers per project
* View report of projects/time which converts to decimal values
* Autobackup of projects time report
    * Saves file to "C:\Temp\TimeReportBackups" every 10 minutes
    * Appends to current file (filename determined when application loads)
    * Flushes directory when gets to contain 50 items, will not delete current file.
* Save project list for future use
* Open saved project list (timers are zeroed out).


Navigating the form:
  * Middle white list box is where your list of projects are displayed along with their current/running time.
  * To add a project, use the text boxes below the main list box to enter a Project ID, Project Name, and Project Description.
  NOTE: The Project ID needs to be unique to those others in the list box.
  * To the right are buttons for Starting/Pausing/Reseting project timers.
  * You can also double-click a project line to start/pause the timer for that project.
  NOTE: Only one project's timer can be running at one time.
  * With the buttons on the right is a label box that will display the current running project and will be green, this is to provide a clearer idea on which is running as the listbox can be hard to read which is running.
  * Below the label is a "Test Backup" button.  This was introduced in version 3.0 to test the autobackup functionality of the time report.  It will likely replace the current View Report/Save function.
